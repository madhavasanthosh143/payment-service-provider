The Payment Validation Service is a microservice developed to ensure the security, integrity, and validity of payment transactions before they are processed. This service acts as a gatekeeper for financial transactions, implementing various validation checks on payment data to prevent fraudulent or incorrect payments.

The service is designed with scalability in mind, capable of handling high transaction volumes without compromising performance. It can be easily integrated into larger systems, such as e-commerce platforms, banking applications, or financial gateways, providing a flexible and reliable solution for businesses requiring secure payment processing.

Key features include:

Data Integrity Checks: Verifies that payment data is accurate and complete.
Fraud Prevention Mechanisms: Uses validation rules to detect potentially fraudulent transactions.
API-Based Integration: Exposes endpoints for quick and seamless integration with other systems.
High Performance and Scalability: Built to handle large volumes of transactions efficiently.
This project is an essential component for any application handling sensitive financial data, offering a secure layer to validate transactions before final processing.
